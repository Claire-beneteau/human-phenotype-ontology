Anti-Tr antibodies are directed against cerebellar Purkinje cells (termed anti-Tr or PCA-Tr). Anti-Tr autoantibodies are frequently associated with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Anti-Tr antibodies are defined by a specific staining pattern in cerebellar tissue that is characterized by punctate immunoreactivity in both the dendritic tree and soma of Purkinje cells but not in their axons. This characteristic pattern is indicative of the presence of anti-Tr antibodies. The Delta/Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER) was identified as the target antigen of anti-Tr."
